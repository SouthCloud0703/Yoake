Software Updates
Always apply latest security patches. Test updates on testnet before mainnet deployment.

Infrastructure Redundancy
Deploy across multiple regions or providers. Enable automatic failover for high availability.

Monitoring & Alerts
Continuously monitor node health and slashing risk. Set up real-time alerts for incidents.
