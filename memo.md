### Security Policy
Key Management
Use HSMs. Keep private keys offline and rotate immediately if compromised.

Network Security
Use sentry nodes to isolate validator. Restrict access with firewalls and VPNs. DDoS protection in place.

Software Updates
Always apply latest security patches. Test updates on testnet before mainnet deployment.

Infrastructure Redundancy
Deploy across multiple regions or providers. Enable automatic failover for high availability.

Monitoring & Alerts
Continuously monitor node health and slashing risk. Set up real-time alerts for incidents.

Access Control
Limit admin access. Enforce least privilege and maintain audit logs.
